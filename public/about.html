<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<h2> Who am I?</h2>
<p>
  I would describe myself as just a simple guy trying to obtain some useful skills in life,  such as programming. 
</p>

<hr/>
<h2>What are my Goals?</h2>
<p>
  My top goal as of right now is to learn as much as possible about programming, with the aim of one day being able to support my family through it.<br/>
  My second highest goal at the moment is to build a website from scratch so that I can create one for one of my best friends' ideas. <br/> 
  I want to be the person who helps him with that.<br/>
  Become the mightiest computer wizard of all time! :)
</p>
<h3>TL:DR</h3>
<ol>
  <li>learn to earn</li>
  <li>support a friend</li>
  <li>become a 0s&1s Wizard</li>
</ol>


<hr/>
<h2>What`s my Motivation</h2>
<p>
  I would be lying if I said the potential financial benefits are not one of my reasons. <br/>
  More than that, it would be, as I have already mentioned, to support my family and friends as much as possible. <br/>
  Being able to buy things for my loved ones and provide help in any way, shape, or form is my biggest reason and motivator for me to learn how to code.<br/>
  To be able to create websites, programs, software, and much more.
</p>

<h3>TL:DR</h3>
<ol>
  <li>earn a lot of money</li>
  <li>make money to give back</li>
  <li>create</li>
</ol>
