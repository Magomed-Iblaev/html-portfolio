<h1>  Top 5 Movies I Have Watched in 2023 According to Me</h1>
<h2>The Best Movies I Have Watched In 2023</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Spider-Man:Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<h4>4,8/5</h4> 
<p>
   The movie was amazing. <br/>
   From the story to the animation, there was nothing that wasn't great.<br/>
   The only downside in my opinion was the cliffhanger at the end.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Barbie</h3>
<h4>4,25/5 </h4>
<p>I went into this movie with low expectations and was simply blown away.<br/>
   The cast was great, especially Ryan Gosling as Ken, and so was the plot.<br/>
   I expected it to be some weird story about a toy that came to life and somehow became <br/> 
   a human, which it was in a way, but it was also much more than that. <br/>
</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3</h3>
<h4>4,2/5</h4>
<p>As a big fan of Marvel and the MCU, I expected just as much from this movie as from GotG: V1 and GotG: V2 and was not disappointed.<br/>
   I liked that this part focused more on Rocket Raccoon, as he is someone we knew very little about before<br/>
   and definitely deserves to be the captain of the GotG after Star-Lord left. <br/>
</p>

<h3>Joker</h3>
<h4>4/5</h4>
<p>This is just in general a good movie. <br/>
   An origin story deserving of its subject.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Avatar: The Way of Water</h3>
<h4>3,75/5</h4>
<p>A maybe not-so-needed sequel but certainly a great one.<br/>
   We saw more of the main characters and their beautiful world and how it's evolving.
