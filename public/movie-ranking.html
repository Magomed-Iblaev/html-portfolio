<h2>Top 5 Best Movies I Watched in 2023 According to Me</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Spider-Man:Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<h4>4,8/5</h4> 
<p>
   The Movie was amazing. <br/>
   From the story to the animation there was nothing that wasnt great.<br/>
   The only bad part about it was the cliffhanger at the end.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Barbie</h3>
<h4>4,25/5 </h4>
<p>I went into this movie with low expectations and was simply blown away.<br/>
    The cast was great, especialy Ryan Gosling as Ken, and so was the plot.<br/>
    I expected it to be some weird story about a toy that came to life and somehow became <br/> 
    a human, wich it was in a way, but it also was much more than that. <br/>
</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3</h3>
<h4>4,2/5</h4>
<p>As a big fan of Marvel and the MCU i expected just as much from this Movie as from GotG:V1 and GotG:V2 and did not get disapointed.<br/>
   I liked that this Part focused more on Rocket Raccon as he is someone who we knew very little about befor<br/>
   and deffenetly is someone who deserves to be the captain of the GotG after StarLord left. <br/>
</p>

<h3>Joker</h3>
<h4>4/5</h4>
<p>This just in general a good Movie. <br/>
   An origin story deserving of its subject.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Avatar: The Way of Water</h3>
<h4>3,75/5</h4>
<p>A maybe not so needed sequel but sertanly a great one.<br/>
   We saw more of the main characters and their beautiful world and how its evolving.
